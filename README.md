# Polar Upgrade Tool

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard-upgrade-tool/master/images/showcase.JPG)

PUT allows you to automatically migrate your icon packs to the latest versions of Polar, without any manual copying. **This project does not migrate your project to Polar from other dashboard templates, it upgrades existing Polar-using icon packs.**

See [Polar's main repository](https://github.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard) for information about Polar.

PUT was designed and developed by [Aidan Follestad](https://github.com/afollestad) and [Patrick J](https://github.com/PDDStudio).

# Download & Wiki
You can find the latest version of PUT's packaged binary in the [Release Page of this Repository](https://github.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard-upgrade-tool/releases).

In case you need more information about how to use this Tool head over to the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/PDDStudio/polar-dashboard-upgrade-tool/wiki/Polar-Dashboard-Upgrade-Tool---Wiki).

The Wiki should guide people which are not common with technical/development stuff through the whole process to get their Polar-using icon pack updated.
