# Polar Upgrade Tool

PUT allows you to automatically migrate your icon packs to the latest versions of Polar, without any manual copying. **This project does not migrate your project to Polar from other dashboard templates, it upgrades existing Polar-using icon packs.**

See [Polar's main repository](https://github.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard) for information about Polar.

PUT was designed and developed by [Aidan Follestad](https://github.com/afollestad) and [Patrick J](https://github.com/PDDStudio).
